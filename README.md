House Price Prediction Using Linear Regression

This project is part of the Prodigy ML internship. It demonstrates how to use **Linear Regression** to predict house prices based on various features like living area, number of rooms, and locality factors.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

> **Implement a linear regression model to predict the prices of houses based on square footage, number of rooms, and environmental parameters.**

## 🧠 Features Used

- `living_area` – Total square footage of the house
- `num_rooms` – Number of rooms (bedrooms/bathrooms)
- `number_of_buildings_in_hectare` – Building density in area
- `travel_time_private_transport` – Commute time
- `population_in_hectare` – Population density
